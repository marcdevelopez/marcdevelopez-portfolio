      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi! I'm <strong>Marc Garc√≠a</strong>, a cross-platform mobile app developer focused on building functional and scalable solutions using <strong>Flutter</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        After earning my European degree in <strong>Multiplatform App Development (DAM)</strong>, I made a big decision:
        I took a two-year leave of absence from my previous job to fully focus on my passion ‚Äî turning software development from a personal hobby into a professional career.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm currently leading <strong>ShuttleBiz</strong>, a Flutter-based mobile app that helps groups of people coordinate shuttle rides with real-time chat and maps.
        I work daily in structured Pomodoro blocks to grow my skills, build my portfolio, and contribute to meaningful projects.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To further expand my knowledge, I'm also studying for a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering</strong> through <strong>UNED (Spain‚Äôs National Distance Education University)</strong>, based in M√°laga.
        This helps me deepen my academic foundation while staying fully active in real-world development.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Alongside my main project, I'm developing <strong>small experimental apps</strong> to test features and gain confidence with the tools I plan to use in ShuttleBiz.
        These mini-projects help me reduce errors in the main app and sharpen my practical understanding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If you find value in those experiments, feel free to <strong>reach out for collaboration</strong>, suggest improvements, or even hire me to help develop your own app ideas ‚Äî
        whether it's a small feature, a prototype, or a complete application based on what I already know how to build.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition, I'm deeply interested in learning and perfecting the development of <strong>online stores and e-commerce platforms</strong>.
        My goal is to help people and small businesses bring their products or services to the world ‚Äî directly, without intermediaries.
        While I respect large platforms like Amazon, I believe there's room for specialized, independent solutions.
        If that's your vision too, I'm here to help you make it happen. I've got the time, energy, and passion to build meaningful digital tools.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        üîç I'm currently open to <strong>remote or freelance opportunities</strong>, and I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and bring real value through clean code and thoughtful design.
      </p>
